Wow... Loved this place.,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.),0
A great touch.,1
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.,0
Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.,1
That's right....the red velvet cake.....ohhh this stuff is so good.,1
This was like the final blow!,0
"Overall, I like this place a lot.",1
Hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didn't want to eat it for fear of getting sick.,0
"On a positive note, our server was very attentive and provided great service.",1
The Heart Attack Grill in downtown Vegas is an absolutely flat-lined excuse for a restaurant.,0
"The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.",1
At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.,0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!,1
A great way to finish a great.,1
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.,1
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.,0
"It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party.",1
say bye bye to your tip lady!,0
"I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious.",1

Penne vodka excellent!,1
This is one of the best bars with food in Vegas.,1
"The service was a little slow , considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace.",0

The best place to go for a tasty bowl of Pho!,1
Food was great and so was the serivce!,1

The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.,1
Hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in.,0
I loved the bacon wrapped dates.,1
This is the place where I first had pho and it was amazing!!,1
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.,1
"Ordered a double cheeseburger & got a single patty that was falling apart (picture uploaded) Yeah, still sucks.",0
"If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.",0
"The descriptions said ""yum yum sauce"" and another said ""eel sauce"", yet another said ""spicy mayo""...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.",0
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.,0
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.,0
Now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty.,1
You cant go wrong with any of the food here.,1
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.,0

"Will never, ever go back.",0
"As much as I'd like to go back, I can't get passed the atrocious service and will never return.",0
Never going back.,0
Great service and food.,1
First - the bathrooms at this location were dirty- Seat covers were not replenished & just plain yucky!!!,0
"This place is like Chipotle, but BETTER.",1
Everyone is treated equally special.,1
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.,0
He deserves 5 stars.,1
I left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day.,0
"They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!",1
I took back my money and got outta there.,0
They have great dinners.,1
WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK AND HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.,0
I will come back here every time I'm in Vegas.,1
This place deserves one star and 90% has to do with the food.,0
This is a disgrace.,0
"I have been here several times in the past, and the experience has always been great.",1
Kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos!,1
Service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see.,1

TOTAL WASTE OF TIME.,0
I don't know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea.,1
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.,1

From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.,1
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.,1
So absolutley fantastic.,1
It was a huge awkward 1.5lb piece of cow that was 3/4ths gristle and fat.,0

The last 3 times I had lunch here has been bad.,0
The inside is really quite nice and very clean.,1

"Love the margaritas, too!",1
"Very good, though!",1

I asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored I went to the hostess and got one myself.,0
"The staff is always super friendly and helpful, which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby!",1
Tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse.,0
"I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.",1

"The owner used to work at Nobu, so this place is really similar for half the price.",1
A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!,1
The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.,0

Your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me.,0
"Very good food, great atmosphere.1",1
"Prices are very reasonable, flavors are spot on, the sauce is home made, and the slaw is not drenched in mayo.",1
The cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me.,1
I work in the hospitality industry in Paradise Valley and have refrained from recommending Cibo any longer.,0
"That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.",1
They have a really nice atmosphere.,1
Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.,0
"After one bite, I was hooked.",1
We ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything.,0

What happened next was pretty....off putting.,0
